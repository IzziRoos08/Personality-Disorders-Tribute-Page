<h2>What is a Personality Disorder</h2>
<p> A personality is a person's way that they think, feel, and behave toward themself or
others. Personalities normally crystallize around the age 10-12 years old; these personalities
are influenced by a person's childhood experiences, enviornment, genetics, and inherited
characteristics. A personality disorder is a long-term pattern of behavoir or thinking 
that is significantly different or abnormal compared to the normal. These 
patterns can begin in childhood, such as borderline, schizotypal, and the beginnings 
of narcisism, and into early adulthood, such as dependent, paranoid, and antisocial. 
All personality disorders affect at least 2 of the following areas:</p>


   <li>An affected person's way of thinking about themself of others</li>
   <li>An affected person's emotion responses to the world around them</li>
   <li>An affected person's ability to relate to others/a person's social skills</li>
   <li>An affected person's ability to control their behavior</li>

<div id="borderline">
    <h4>Borderline Personality Disorder:</h4>
<p><em>People with Borderline Personality Disorder often experience intense, unstable emotions and moods that have the potential to shift almost instantly. They generally have a hard time calming themselves down once they become upset. As a result of this, these people frequently have angry outbursts and engage in impulsive behaviors such as substance abuse, self-injury, overspending, or binge eating. These behaviors often function to soothe them in the short term but harm them in the longer term. This is the most widely studied personality disorder.</em></p>

<p>Some other chracteristics of this disorder include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Applying harsh judgments to others and to themselves and their perceptions of themselves and others may quickly vacillate back and forth between "all good" and "all bad."</li>
<li> Often have an unstable sense of self, therefore people with this disorder tend to have a hard time being consistent.</li>
<li>Frequently change careers, relationships, life goals, or residences. Quite often these radical changes occur without any warning or advance preparation.</li>
<li>Indulge in impulsive and risky behavior.<li>
<li>Often experience bipolar-like moods, often as a reaction to interpersonal stress.</li>
<li>Ongoing feelings of emptiness.</li>
	</ul>
<p>People with Borderline Personality Disorder view the world in terms of black-and-white. Their tendency to see the world in polarized terms makes it easy for them to misinterpret the actions and motivations of others. These polarized thoughts with things such as friendships or relationships can lead them to experience intense emotional reactions, which in turn interact with their difficulties in regulating these intense emotions. The result of this is they will characteristically experience strong feelings of distress, which they cannot easily control, and may subsequently engage in self-destructive behaviors as they do their best to cope. The intensity of their emotions, coupled with their difficulty regulating these emotions, leads them to act impulsively.

<h2>What Causes Personality Disorders?</h2>

<img src="https://cdn1.stayprepared.sg/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2020/12/understanding-personality-disorders-2.jpg" width="400">

<p>Personality disorders generally develop during childhood. A person's personality usually crystalizes by the ages 10-12. Certain personality traits can become too rigid while some others can be underdeveloped. Certain conditions can cause these specific traits to be under or overdeveloped. These conditions include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Physical Childhood Abuse</li>
    <li>Verbal Abuse</li>
    <li>Unsafe Environment</li>
    <li>Child separation/neglect from parents or guardians</li>
	</ul>
<p>Other than childhood problems, some personality disorders can be caused by genetics or people living in an environment with others with a personality disorder. Other disorders develop as a mental escape or a coping mechanism for some.</p>

<h2>Risks of Personality Disorders</h2>

<img src="https://img.rawpixel.com/s3fs-private/rawpixel_images/website_content/v211batch11-kib-283-drugs_2.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&dpr=1&fit=clip&crop=default&fm=jpg&q=75&vib=3&con=3&usm=15&cs=srgb&bg=F4F4F3&ixlib=js-2.2.1&s=ba749d3ca3349121976b5f282761e4e2" width="400">

<p>The risks of personality disorders generally arise when they are left untreated. When untreated, these disorders can cause great social and personal losses for a person. Some of these losses include a loss in productivity, increased hospitalization, increased depression, and, in some cases, imprisonment. People with untreated personality disorders can also be at risk for drug and alcohol abuse, violence toward others, or self-harming behavior (including suicide).</p>

<h2>General Treatments for Personality Disorders</h2>

<img src="https://finestservices.com.sg/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/insightful_counselling2-1024x732.jpg" width="400">

<p>Personality disorders are extremely hard to treat and are pretty much incurable. Treatments for these disorders can only make the patient more comfortable and calmer with themselves and others. Some symptoms of these disorders can be cured, but most aspects of the disorder cannot be fixed. Some of the most popular and the most effective treatments for personality disorders include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Psychotherapy</li>
    <li>Dialectal Behavioral Therapy</li>
    <li>Some medications including antidepressants, anti-psychotics, anti-anxiety drugs, and impulse-stabilizing medications</li>
	</ul>
